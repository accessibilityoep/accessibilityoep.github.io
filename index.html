							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>The one-day in-person workshop will consist of five sessions, with a focus on participant interaction. We will plan to have a hybrid format for participants who cannot join us physically. We will ensure that everyone who takes part remotely can still contribute to the workshop activities and discussion meaningfully. Video recordings of all discussions will be uploaded on the webpage www.abc.com for future reference. More details will be communicated closer to time.
							The organizers are also prepared to conduct the workshop completely online if necessary. We plan to use the infrastructure of Zoom https://zoom.us) and Miro (https://miro.com) for collaborative interaction. for the complete online session, the timings of the session will be fixed based on the variety of time zones participants are from. The availability of the timeslot will be collated via a survey by the organizers.

							Accepted papers will be accessible on the website before the workshop.
							The discussion and submission will be focused around the themes mentioned.</p>

									<h3>Goals</h3>
									<!-- <p>Phasellus convallis elit id ullam corper amet et pulvinar. Duis aliquam turpis mauris, sed ultricies erat dapibus.</p> -->
									<ul>
										<li><u><span style="color: #31254F">Awareness</span></u>: Online educational platforms generated a growth of 53% 1 in revenue from 2019 to 2021. The demand
											for such platforms and content is growing since the pandemic. However, the platforms are ill-equipped to
											handle accessibility challenges. The workshop aims to raise awareness about the challenges and opportunities
											that this field brings.</li>
										<li><u><span style="color: #31254F">Community Building</span></u>: Focus on the accessibility of educational platforms and content is still in its nascent stage
											and the research is mostly restricted to academic or industry research labs but in a disjointed manner. The goal
											of this workshop is to bring researchers and practitioners from diverse academic and industry backgrounds for
											future collaborations, and community building</li>
										<li><u><span style="color: #31254F">Research Repository</span></u>: Online educational platforms can encompass research and development from computer
											science, psychology, sociology, education, policy-making, and other diverse backgrounds. It is thus important
											to document the contributions of different fields of work in a cohesive manner. In this workshop, we aim to
											start building and enriching the repository</li>

									<h3>Themes</h3>
									<!-- <p>Phasellus convallis elit id ullam corper amet et pulvinar. Duis aliquam turpis mauris, sed ultricies erat dapibus.</p> -->
									<ul>
										<li>Current Issues: Accessibility often becomes a decisive factor that impedes the adoption of user interfaces - and online educational platforms are also not an exception. This theme focuses on factors related to physical/motor, auditory, visual and neuro-diverse challenges which are often ignored or not addressed completely causing frustration amongst users and also leading to potential dropouts</li>
										<li>Opportunities: We initiate discussions to identify opportunities that can lead to quicker adoption of user interfaces in online educational platforms. This theme also focuses on opportunities from the research perspective which could be investigated and implemented on currently available systems to improve their adaptability to impairments</li>
										<li>Applications: Accessing content from different devices open up possibilities for spreading information and education from the same platform. This theme will discuss potential applications that can be beneficial from the platform-centric approach to impart education. For example, phone and tablet-based applications overcome interaction challenges that were not present in the desktop version.</li>
										<li>Designs and Protocols: This theme will focus on understanding and discussing design models that will be suitable for UIs of online educational platforms. Generic guidelines of the W3C for accessibility while existing, are not implemented properly. The theme will also focus on formal regulations that should be in place in order to avoid interference or privacy violations when checking for content accessibility upon platform upload. We will build on both existing data protection regulations proposed by the European Union (EU) and the United Nations (UN) as well as concepts of data and information literacy</li>
										<li>Social Benefits: Hindrance to accessible materials on a non-accessible platform often leads to frustrations and dejection \cite{}. It becomes increasingly important in a society where increased mental fatigue just because of poorly designed and organized platforms could potentially lead to withdrawal from the educational content. In this theme, we discuss the social impact our designs and approaches can bring and how can we evaluate them to train and improve our systems for increased adaptability.</li>
